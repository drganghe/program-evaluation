## Bombing strategy in Vietnam

- Discontinuities in U.S. strategies employed during the Vietnam War to estimate their causal impacts. 
- Rounding thresholds in an algorithm used to target air strikes
- Bombing increased the military and political activities of the communist insurgency, weakened local governance, and reduced noncommunist civic engagement. 
- Spatial discontinuity across neighboring military regions that pursued different counterinsurgency strategies. 
- A strategy emphasizing overwhelming firepower plausibly increased insurgent attacks and worsened attitudes toward the U.S. and South Vietnamese government, relative to a more hearts-and-minds-oriented approach.


## Thoughts for evaluation

- Natural experiments   
- Causal identification strategies
- Regression discountinuity

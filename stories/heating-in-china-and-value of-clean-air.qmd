## Heating differences between the North and South in China

- China’s Huai River policy: free winter heating via the provision of coal for boilers in cities north of the Huai River but denied heat to the south. 
- Regression discontinuity design based on distance from the Huai River
- Ambient concentrations of TSPs are about 184 μg/m3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 61, 307] or 55% higher in the north. 
- Life expectancies are about 5.5 y (95% CI: 0.8, 10.2) lower in the north owing to an increased incidence of cardiorespiratory mortality. 
- Long-term exposure to an additional 100 μg/m3 of TSPs is associated with a reduction in life expectancy at birth of about 3.0 y (95% CI: 0.4, 5.6).



## Thoughts for evaluation

- Natural experiments   
- Causal identification strategies
- Regression discountinuity

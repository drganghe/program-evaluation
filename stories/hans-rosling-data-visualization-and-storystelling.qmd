## Hans Rosling

- Swedish physician, academic and public speaker. 
- 1948 - 2017


## Gapminder and data storytelling

- *Don't Panic - The Truth about Population* (2013)
- *Don't Panic: How to End Poverty in 15 Years* (2015)
- "The world is better than you think"
- Book: *Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World â€“ and Why Things Are Better Than You Think*

>I'm a very serious "possibilist". That's something I made up. It means someone who neither hopes without reason, nor fears without reason, someone who constantly resists the overdramatic worldview. As a possibilist, I see all this progress, and it fills me with conviction and hope that further progress is possible. This is not optimistic. It is having a clear and reasonable idea about how things are. It is having a worldview that is constructive and useful.

--Han Rosling

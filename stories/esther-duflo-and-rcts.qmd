## Esther Duflo


## RCTs

>But Abhijit immediately understood the power of RCTs, not just as a tool to evaluate programs, but as a way of turning development economics on its head by giving us the freedom to put any theory to the test. 

-- [Esther Duflo Biographical](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2019/duflo/biographical/)


## Thoughts for evaluation

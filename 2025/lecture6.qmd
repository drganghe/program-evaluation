## Recap lecture 5

- Evaluation design
- RCT
- Case: Microfinance and RCT
- Proposal


## Today's agenda

- Quasi-experimental design
  - Regression discontinuity
  - Difference in differences
  - Matching
- Case: Air quality and Life Expectancy


## Capturing the wedege

## Evaluation designs{.smaller}

- Experimental   
  - Randomised controled trial

- Quasi-experimental   
  - Instrumental variable (IV)
  - Regression discontinuity (RDD)
  - Difference in differences (DiD)

- Observational (Non-experimental)  
  - Time–series analysis (Pre- and post-intervention studies)
  - Cross-sectional surveys
  - Case studies


## Instrumental variable design

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"}
An instrumental variable:

- It influences the likelihood of participating in a program  
- Outside of the participant’s control 
- Unrelated to the participant’s characteristics

Examples:

- Test scores
- Geographic proximity
- Month of birth
- Rainfall
:::


## RDD design

Application: programs that have a continuous eligibility index with clearly defined eligibility threshold to determine who is eligible and who is not.

- The index must rank people or units in continuous way.
- The index must have a clearly defined cutoff score.
- The cutoff must be unique to the program of interest.
- The score of particular individual or unit cannot be manipulated.

## DiD design

- Compares the CHANGES in outcomes over time between the treatment group the comparison group.
- First Difference: time-varying factors
- Second Difference: treatment effects
- Trend differences


## DiD example: Employment

## Equal trends in DiD

## Testing for equal trends in DiD

- Repeated comparisons: year -2, -1, and 0
- Placebo test: a fake treatment group
- Fake treatment group + Fake outcome
- Different comparison group


## Matching

> Matching uses large data sets and statistical techniques to construct the best possible comparison group based on observed characteristics.
>
>For every possible unit under treatment, it attempts to fi nd a nontreatment unit (or set of nontreatment units) that has the most similar characteristics possible.


## Curse of dimensionality

Increased matching dimensions reduces matching possibilities.

## Propensity score matching

Uses a probability score to find the best possible comparison group.

## Key issues in matching

- Matching can use only observed characteristics
- Using only characteristics that are not affected by the program
- Eesimation are only as good as the characteristics used for matching (understanding the criteria for participation)

## Cost-benefit analysis

<center>
Benefits > Costs = Good Program?
</center>


## Ten steps{.smaller}

1. Set the framework for the analysis.
2. Decide whose costs and benefits should be recognized.
3. Identify and categorize costs and benefits.
4. Project costs and benefits over the life of the program, if applicable.
5. Monetize (place a dollar value on) costs.
6. Quantify benefits in terms of units of effectiveness (for CEA) or monetize benefits (for CBA).
7. Discount costs and benefits to obtain present values.
8. Compute a cost-effectiveness ratio (for CEA) or net present value (for CBA).
9. Perform sensitivity analysis.
10. Make a recommendation where appropriate.

## How about

- Happiness
- Justice

- Costs


## Limitations

- Bias on costs and benefits
- Non-market value
- Uncertainties


## Beyond CBA

- Outcomes
- Outputs
- Efficiency
- Service quality
- Customer satisfaction
- Quality of life
- Social justice

## Organization challenges

- Aligning incentives
- Making tradeoffs
- Asking the right questions
- Finding the right timing


## Challenge 1: Aligning incentives

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"} 
- Program implementers
- Donors

Stategies:

- Separate accountability from learning and impact
- Focus impact evaluation on important strategic questions
- Consider impact evaluation as an opportunity for R&D
- Reframe donor expectations: help donor make decision about supporting similar programs

## Challenge 2: Making tradeoffs

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"} 

- Resources for evalution or intervention
- Data collection costs
- Program staff evaluation requirements

Stategies:

- Senior management buy-in
- Outside resources to support evaluation
- Targetd evaluation support
- Training

## Challenge 3: Asking the right questions

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"} 
>A good evaluation questioon is one that seeks to confirm or bettter understand the program's theory of change and generate actionale information for decision makers.

- Clear thory of change
- Generate transportable knowledge

Stategies:

- Senior management buy-in
- Internal analytical capacity and other relevant resources
- Systematic review

## Challenge 4: Find the right timing

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"} 
>The evaluation results will be most useful in making decisions about expanding or replicating a program, or changing important aspects of how the program is delivered.

- Time to make decision about program design
- Delays

Stategies:

- Project maturity
- Consistent implementation
- Timing of decision

## Overcome challenges

:::{style="font-size: 28px;"} 
- High-priority questions to the organization, with a strong organizational consensus around the need for impact evidence;
- A review of available evidence should demonstrate that there are knowledge gaps worth filling;
- A commitment to acting on the results of the evaluation;
- The program should be sufficiently mature with a strong M&E system in place;
- The costs of conducting an evaluation should be justified relative to its benefits and both costs as well as benefits should be clearly defined.

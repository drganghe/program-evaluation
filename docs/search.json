Emphasis is placed on the design and implementation of small- to medium-scale program evaluations under time and budget constraints using ‘best feasible’ methods. Topics include the types and purposes of evaluation, theory-based evaluation, evaluability and planning, measurement and construct validity, data collection, evaluation design, estimation of program effects, experiments, qualitative and mixed methods, evaluation resistance, building organizational capacity, ethics, cost-effectiveness, and reporting and utilization. The course will be useful to students working in a variety of mission-driven organizations, especially those who currently have, or expect to have in the future, program evaluation responsibilities."

It is designed to go through the center of blocks, rather than over the avenue, carrying goods to and from Manhattan’s largest industrial district.”\n“1980s: Following decades-long growth in the interstate trucking industry, the last train runs on the High Line in 1980, pulling three carloads of frozen turkeys. A group of property owners lobbies for demolition while Peter Obletz, a Chelsea resident, activist, and railroad enthusiast, challenges demolition efforts in court.”\n“1999: Friends of the High Line is founded by Joshua David and Robert Hammond, residents of the High Line neighborhood, to advocate for the High Line’s preservation and reuse as public open space.”\nSection 1 opened in 2009; Section 2 in 2011; Section 3 in 2014; The Spur in 2018."

Emphasis is placed on the design and implementation of small- to medium-scale program evaluations under time and budget constraints using ‘best feasible’ methods. Topics include the types and purposes of evaluation, theory-based evaluation, evaluability and planning, measurement and construct validity, data collection, evaluation design, estimation of program effects, experiments, qualitative and mixed methods, evaluation resistance, building organizational capacity, ethics, cost-effectiveness, and reporting and utilization. The course will be useful to students working in a variety of mission-driven organizations, especially those who currently have, or expect to have in the future, program evaluation responsibilities."

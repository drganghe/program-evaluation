## Program & Program Evaluation{.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
Program:  

>A program is a set of resources and activities directed toward one or more common goals, typically under the direction of a single manager or management team.

::: {.column width="50%"}
Program Evaluation: 

> Program evaluation is the application of systematic methods to address questions about program operations and results. It may include ongoing monitoring of a program as well as one-shot studies of program processes or program impact. The approaches used are based on social science research methodologies and professional standards.

## Five questions to ask

- Can the results of the evaluation influence decisions about the program?
- Can the evaluation be done in time to be useful?
- Is the program significant enough to merit evaluation?
- Is program performance viewed as problematic?
- Where is the program in its development?

Formative &harr; Summative   
Ongoing &harr; One-Shot   
Objective &harr; Observers Participatory  
Goal-Oriented &harr;“Goal-Free”   
Quantitative &harr;Qualitative   
Ex Ante &harr; Post Program   
Problem Orientation &harr; Non-Problem

## Exploratory evaluation

::: {style="font-size: 20px;"}
| Approach | Purpose | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluability assessment | Assess whether programs are ready for useful evaluation; get agreement on program goals and evaluation criteria; clarify the focus and intended use of further evaluation. | 1 to 6 months; 2 staff-weeks to 3 staff-months|
| Rapid feedback evaluation | Estimate program effectiveness in terms of agreed-on program goals; indicate the range of uncertainty in the estimates; produce tested designs for more definitive evaluation; clarify the focus and intended use of further evaluation. | 3 to 6 months; 3 to 12 staff-months |
| Evaluation synthesis | Synthesize findings of prior research and evaluation studies. | 1 to 4 months; 1 to 3 staff-months |
| Small-sample studies | Estimate program effectiveness in terms of agreed-on program goals; produce tested measures of program performance. | 1 week to 6 months; 1 staff-week to 12 staff-month |

## Evaluability Standards: Readiness for Useful Evaluation

- Program goals are agreed on and realistic.
- Information needs are well defined.
- Evaluation data are obtainable.
- Intended users are willing and able to use evaluation information.

## Selecting an exploratory evaluation approach

::: {style="font-size: 24px;"}
| Approach | When Appropriate|
|---|---|
| Evaluability assessment | Large, decentralized program; unclear evaluation criteria.|
| Rapid feedback evaluation | Agreement exists on the goals in terms of which a program is to be evaluated; need for evaluation information “right quick”; potential need for more definitive evaluation. |
| Evaluation synthesis | Need for evaluation information “right quick”; potential need for more definitive evaluation. |
| Small-sample studies | Agreement exists on the goals in terms of which a program is to be evaluated; collection of evaluation data will require sampling.|

- Culture of the program that is being evaluated
- Cultural parameters 
- Including equity

## GAO’s Evaluation Design Process

- clarify the study objectives; 
- obtain background information on the issue and design options;
- develop and test the proposed approach; 
- reach agreement on the proposed approach.

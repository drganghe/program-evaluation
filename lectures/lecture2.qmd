Program Evaluation:

The approaches used are based on social science research methodologies and professional standards.

## Five questions to ask

- Can the results of the evaluation influence decisions about the program?
- Can the evaluation be done in time to be useful?
- Is the program significant enough to merit evaluation?
- Is program performance viewed as problematic?
- Where is the program in its development?


## Type of evaluation

Formative Summative
Ongoing One-Shot
Objective Observers Participatory
Goal-Oriented “Goal-Free”
Quantitative Qualitative
Ex Ante Post Program
Problem Orientation Non-Problem

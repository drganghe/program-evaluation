Program Evaluation: 

> Program evaluation is the application of systematic methods to address questions about program operations and results. It may include ongoing monitoring of a program as well as one-shot studies of program processes or program impact. The approaches used are based on social science research methodologies and professional standards.

## Five questions to ask

- Can the results of the evaluation influence decisions about the program?
- Can the evaluation be done in time to be useful?
- Is the program significant enough to merit evaluation?
- Is program performance viewed as problematic?
- Where is the program in its development?

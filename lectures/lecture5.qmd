## Recap lecture 4

- Stakeholders
- Identify key stakeholder
- Engaging stakeholders
- ARPR-E case
- Role play, stakeholder conflict


## Today's agenda

- Evaluation design
- RCT
- Other strategies
- Proposal
- Caucus on progress on evaluation project


## Counterfactural: What if?

:::{style="text-align:center"}
What would have happened in the absence of the program?

How do we measure what would have happened if the other circumstance had prevailed?
:::


## Comparison group

Individual level effect is impossible to observe.

No individual counterfactuals.


## Naive design

- **Naturally occurring** treated and untreated groups
- Examples
  - Students who participated pre-K (test scores)
  - Moms who use anesthetic (hospital stays)
- Questions to ask: Do we expect that if the program had not been offered, the outcomes of the treated and untreated comparison groups would have been roughly the same?


## Challenges

- Self-selection
- Selection bias


## The power of randomized

Comparing average outcomes only works if groups that received/didn't receive treatment look the same.

## Random assignment methods

- Coins
- Dice
- Lottery
- Random numbers



## Steps in RCTs

## What can be randomized?

Different ways to randomize come from three basic elements of a program which can be randomized

- Access: which people are offered access to a program

- Timing: when people are offered access

- Encouragement: which people are given encouragement to participate

## When to use RCTs?

- Demand for treatment exceeds supply
- Treatment will be phased in over time
- Treatment is in equipoise (genuine uncertainty)
- Local culture open to randomization
- When you're a nondemocratic monopolist
- When people won't know (and it's ethical!)
- When lotteries are going to happen anyway


## When not?

- When you need immediate results
- When it's unethical or illegal
- When it's something that happened in the past
- When it involves universal ongoing phenomena

## Story

Esther Duflo and RCTs

## Quasi experiment design

Not randomized assignments

- Regression discontinuity design (RDD) 
- Difference in differences (DiD) 
- Other designs


## Regression discontinuity design (RDD)

Programs that have a continuous eligibility index with a
clearly defined eligibility threshold (cutoff score) to determine who is
eligible and who is not.

- The index must rank people or units in a continuous or “smooth” way.
- The index must have a clearly defined cutoff score.
- The cutoff must be unique to the program of interest.
- The score of a particular individual or unit cannot be manipulated.


## Difference in differences (DiD)

compares the changes in outcomes over time between a population that is enrolled in a program (the treatment group) and a population that is not (the comparison group).

## Rule of thumb

- Correlation is the beginning of understanding what happens to a group
- Correlation does not equal causation
- Evaluation design will depends on possibility, feasibility, and appropriability

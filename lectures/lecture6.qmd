## Recap lecture 5

- Evaluation design
- RCT
- Quasi-experimental (RD, DiD)
- Observational
- Proposal
- Progress on evaluation project


## Today's agenda

- Data sources
- Statistical data
- Survey
- Interview
- Evaluation project consultation


## Literature review

- Google Scholar
- Review articles
- Experts interview
- Examples


## Existing data

- Economic, census statistics
- Open data platforms ([NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), [Open Data NY](https://data.ny.gov/), [data.gov](https://data.gov/))  
- Program data

Example: Prof. MacBride's Queens Curbside Recycling study


## Collecting program data

- Experiments
- Interview
- Survey
- Field
- Case study


## Probabilistic sampling

- Random sampling
- Stratified random sampling
- Cluster sampling


## Sample size: Power calculations

"Smallest sample (lowest budget)" to possibly measure program impact.


## Survey Challenges

- Response rate
- Quality and consistency
- Data security


## Survey strategies

- Concise/short
- Start with an easy quesiton (yes or no to get "hooked")
- Donot leading questions
- Show progress/time
- Brainstorm ideas to get good-quality of survey

institutional features, outcomes.   
- To **explain** why the situations are as they are.


## Strategies

- Provide incentives
- Optimize survey length
- Follow up
- Multiple channels
- Targeted audience
- Avoid repetitive


## Tools of trade

- Google/Microsoft Forms
- Survey Monkey
- Qualtrics
- Amazon 


## Train staff

- Goals, process, and responses
- Assessment
- Mock interviews


## Test instruments

- Clear vague and biased wording
- Logical order
- Completeness of intended data


## Run pilot

- Get feedback and comments
- Revision
- Refining

Ready for a full implementation.

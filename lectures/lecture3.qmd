## Elements of a program

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
Inputs:  

Things that go into an activity; money, people, time, etc.

Activities:

Actions that convert inputs to outputs; things that the program does
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Outputs:

Tangible goods and services produced by activities; you have control over these


Outcomes:

What happens when the target population uses the outputs; you don't have control over these

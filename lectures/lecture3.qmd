## Elements of a program

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
Inputs:  

Things that go into an activity; money, people, time, etc.

Activities:

Actions that convert inputs to outputs; things that the program does
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Outputs:

Tangible goods and services produced by activities; you have control over these


Outcomes:

What happens when the target population uses the outputs; you don't have control over these

Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes

## Data

- Experimental: you have control over which units receive treatment
- Observational: you do not have control over which units receive treatment


## Natural experiments

Real experiments could be 
- High costs  
- Unethical  
- Infeasible  


## Stories

-Chen Y, Ebenstein A, Greenstone M, Li H. Evidence on the impact of sustained exposure to air pollution on life expectancy from China’s Huai River policy. *PNAS* 2013. <https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300018110>.


## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

Directed: Each node has an arrow that points to another node

Acyclic: You can't cycle back to a node (and arrows only have one direction)

Graph: It's a graph

## Draw a DAG

Step 1: List variables

Step 2: Simplify

Step 3: Connect arrows

Step 4: Use logic and math to determine
which nodes and arrows to measure

## Causal identification

A causal effect is identified if the association between treatment and outcome is propertly stripped and isolated.

- Arrows in a DAG transmit associations  
- We can redirect and control those paths by "adjusting" or "conditioning"


## 


## Causal models

- Randomized controlled trail (RCT)
- Regressional discontinuity (RD)
- Diference in difference (DiD)

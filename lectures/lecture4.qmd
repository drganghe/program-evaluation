## Stakeholder Identification and Analysis Techniques

- Conducting basic stakeholder identification and analysis
- Choosing evaluation stakeholder analysis participants
- Drafting a purpose network diagram (or purpose hierarchy)


## Questions to ask{.smaller}

- Who the evaluation sponsor(s) is.   
- Who the day-to-day process champion(s) is, meaning the day-to-day evaluation process manager; this person may be the evaluator, but maybe not.   
- Who the stakeholders, key stakeholders, and primary intended users are.   
- What the purpose(s) or intended use(s) of the evaluation is.   
- Who the members of the evaluation coordinating committee or task force are, if such a group is to be formed.   
- How the different stakeholders will be involved at different stages in the evaluation process.   
- Who the evaluator(s) is, or at least what his or her qualifications should be, and who the members of any required evaluation team might be.  


## Types of stakeholders

- Implementers
- Decision makers
- Participants
- Partners

## Prioritize stakeholders{.smaller}

Government Relations team example

- Level 1 Stakeholders will include highly ranked officials like ministers, members of parliament, governors, senators, and members of congress. You decide to engage with these officials on a monthly basis. 
- Level 2 Stakeholders will include people like local elected officials who you need to engage with for the same purpose, but not as often. Your team will engage with these people quarterly. 
- Level 3 Stakeholders will include people who aren’t directly involved but who need to be kept informed about your efforts, like directors of community organizations and committee leaders. You decide to update them annually.

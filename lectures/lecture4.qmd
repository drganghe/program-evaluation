- Who the stakeholders, key stakeholders, and primary intended users are.   
- What the purpose(s) or intended use(s) of the evaluation is.   
- Who the members of the evaluation coordinating committee or task force are, if such a group is to be formed.   
- How the different stakeholders will be involved at different stages in the evaluation process.   
- Who the evaluator(s) is, or at least what his or her qualifications should be, and who the members of any required evaluation team might be.

## Prioritize stakeholders{.smaller}

New York offshore wind delay evaluation example

- Level 1 Stakeholders will include developers, State policy makers, regulators. You decide to in close contact with these groups on a monthly basis. 
- Level 2 Stakeholders will include people like local policy makers, utilities who you need to engage with for the same purpose, but not as often. Your team will engage with these people quarterly. 
- Level 3 Stakeholders will include people who aren’t directly involved but who need to be kept informed about your efforts, like heads of community organizations and advocacy groups, and committee leaders. You decide to update them half-yearly/annually.

## Word counting{.smaller}

- 2,406: Number of words in President Obama's inaugural speech
- 4: Number of times the president said "crisis"
- 3: Number of times he said "economy"
- 2: Number of times he said "war"
- 67: Number of times he said "our"
- 2: Number of times he said "my"
- 1: Number of times he said "change"
- 11: Number of times he said "new"

Discuss the limitations of word counting

## R squared{.smaller}

"The proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)."

$R^2$ does not indicate whether: 

- the independent variables are a cause of the changes in the dependent variable;
- omitted-variable bias exists;
- the correct regression was used;
- the most appropriate set of independent variables has been chosen;
- there is collinearity present in the data on the explanatory variables;
- the model might be improved by using transformed versions of the existing set of independent variables;
- there are enough data points to make a solid conclusion.

## Statiscal significance

p value: "The lower the p-value is, the lower the probability of getting that result if the null hypothesis were true."

## Program & Program Evaluation {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Program:

> A program is a set of resources and activities directed toward one or more common goals, typically under the direction of a single manager or management team.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Program Evaluation:

> Program evaluation is the application of systematic methods to address questions about program operations and results. It may include ongoing monitoring of a program as well as one-shot studies of program processes or program impact. The approaches used are based on social science research methodologies and professional standards.

## Evidence based policy

Example: RAND's Health Insurance Experiment (HIE)

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](/images/RAND-health-experiences.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Key findings**:

::: {style="font-size: 24px;"}
-   Cost sharing reduced spending for health care services
-   Participants with cost sharing made fewer medical visits and were admitted to hospitals less frequently
-   Reduced spending resulted entirely from less use of care; the costs of care were not affected
-   Cost sharing had no detrimental effects on participants' health, except for the sickest and poorest patients

## Not all policies are based on evidence

-   Value
-   Politics
-   Feasibility
-   Quality of evidence and research

## Program Evaluation

::: {style="text-align:center; font-size: 36px;"}
Data Science + Causal Inference
:::

## Case studies

-   Food service resuse system for Governor's Island
-   Northwest Housing Associates
-   Jobs Plus in New York City
-   Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy
-   Benefits and Costs of the Clean Air Act 1990-2020

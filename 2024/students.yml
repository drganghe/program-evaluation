      title: "EMPA Student Somia El-Rowmeim Named to City & State's 2023 Brooklyn Power 100 list"
      description: "Somia El-Rowmeim has dedicated her life to engaging her community in Brooklyn civic life, mobilizing voters and stamping out anti-Muslim hatred. She founded the Women’s Empowerment Coalition of NYC four years ago with an aim of organizing the borough’s immigrant women across cultures and was a David Prize finalist for her idea. El-Rowmeim has since raised awareness about women facing discrimination for wearing keffiyehs and hijabs in public and pushed for a new legislation ordering the state to disaggregate data for Middle Eastern and North African New Yorkers."

## Elements of a program{.smaller}

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Inputs**:  

Things that go into an activity; money, people, time, etc.

**Activities**:

Actions that convert inputs to outputs; things that the program does
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Outputs**:

Tangible goods and services produced by activities; you have control over these


**Outcomes**:

What happens when the target population uses the outputs; you don't have control over these
:::

:::

:::{style="text-align:center;"}

Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Final outcomes

## Data

- Experimental: you have control over which units receive treatment
- Observational: you do not have control over which units receive treatment


## Natural experiments

Real experiments could be   

- High costs  
- Infeasible  
- Unethical  



## Stories

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

Directed: Each node has an arrow that points to another node

Acyclic: You can't cycle back to a node (and arrows only have one direction)

Graph: It's a graph

## Draw a DAG

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

Step 1: List variables

Step 2: Simplify

Step 3: Connect arrows

Step 4: Use logic and math to determine which nodes and arrows to measure

What is the causal effect of an additional year of education on earnings?

## Causal identification

A causal effect is identified if the association between treatment and outcome is propertly stripped and isolated.

- Arrows in a DAG transmit associations  
- We can redirect and control those paths by "adjusting" or "conditioning"


## Three types of associations

:::{style="text-align:center;"}

::: columns

::: {.column width="33%"}
Confounding: Common cause

![](/images/confounding-dag.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
Causation: Mediation

![](/images/mediation-dag.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
Collision: Endogeneity/Selection

## Confounding example

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}
What's the relations between money and win margin?

![](/images/money-elections-dag.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Money $\rightarrow$ Win   
Money $\leftarrow$ Quality $\rightarrow$ Win   
Quality is a backdoor   

Solution:

:::{style="font-size: 24px;"}

- Find the part of campaign money that is explained by quality, remove it. This is the residual part of money.

- Find the part of win margin that is explained by quality, remove it. This is the residual part of win margin.

- Find the relationship between the residual part of money and residual part of win margin. This is the causal effect.

## Causasion example

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](/images/edu-earn-full-dag.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Should you control job connections?

- Avoid overcontrolling

## Colliders example

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](/images/programming-social-skills-dag.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Do programming skills reduce social skills?

Hired by a tech company inadvertently connected the two.

## Colliders example

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](/images/nba-height-dag.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Height is unrelated to basketball skill among NBA players

- Colliders can create fake causal effects

- Colliders can hide real causal effects

## Counterfacture, intervention, and effects

::: columns

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](/images/edu-earn-experiment.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Control backdoors
- Average treatment effect
- Sub groups (age, race, ethnicity, income, etc.)

:::

:::




## Causal models

- Instrumental variables
- Randomized controlled trail (RCT)
- Regressional discontinuity (RD)
- Diference in difference (DiD)
- Matching

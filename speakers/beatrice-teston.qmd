## About

Evaluation in the field of emergency management involves analyzing emergency response operations through after-action reviews. An After-Action Report (AAR) is a structured analysis conducted after an event/incident to identify best practices, challenges, and formulate corrective actions that can be integrated into future operations to support continuous improvement efforts.

This presentation will cover the after-action process, methods for evaluation
(quantitative and qualitative), and evaluation challenges we face in the field of
emergency management.
